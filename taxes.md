# Taxes mod

This server has various taxes. To see how much you owe, run `/trigger balanceCheck`. If you don't pay your balance off, bad things might happen.

## Balances

To pay taxes, throw some emeralds on the ground within 5 blocks of you, and run `/trigger pay`. Any overpayment will be applied to future taxes. In fact, you may want to pay some emeralds before incurring any fines to provide a safety net.

## Brazil

Every 10 minutes, the server sends anyone with outstanding fines to [Brazil](brazil.md).
