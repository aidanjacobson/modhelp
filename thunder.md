# Thunder Mod

Summon a thunderstorm on demand.

## Summoning

Throw 5 diamonds on the ground nearby, then run `/trigger thunder`. The diamonds will be consumed, and a thunderstorm will begin.

## Troubleshooting

Make sure that the diamonds have combined into one entity on the ground (e.g. they are not rotating separately) or else it will not work.
