# Villager Additions

## Villager spawn egg mod

This mod allows you to convert villagers into spawn eggs through a specific process for easy villager transportation. Note that if you create a villager spawn egg from a villager, it will not retain it's memories and data (e.g. it will not be leveled up)

### Obtaining heads

To convert a villager, you must first obtain it's head. This can be done by killing it with an axe that is enchanted with `Silk Touch`.

### Creating Spawn Eggs

To create a villager spawn egg, you must craft the head together with a glistering melon. See [crafting recipes](crafting.md).

## Adrenochrome
Killing a brazillager while in [Brazil](brazil.md) drops adrenochrome. Adrenochrome can be used to cure [AIDS](std.md).
