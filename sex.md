# Sex Mod and Condom Mod
The sex mod is very easy to use. Simply run `/trigger horny`, which will cause you to toggle between horny and not horny (characterized by anger particles above your head). Going near another horny person will cause you to begin having sex with them (heart particles). After sex, you will both announce your fornication, and recieve post-nut clarity.

# Condoms
If you don't wear a condom during sex, there is a 30% chance of having a child. Additionally, even if you wear a condom, there is a 5% chance of it breaking, in which case there is still a 30% chance of having a child. If you have a child, you must pay $15 in child support. (See [Taxes](taxes.md))

## How to make a condom
Place a button on the top of a crafting table, facing upwards. Then, with leather in your main hand, click the button to recieve one condom. Condoms can be equipped like armor leggings.
