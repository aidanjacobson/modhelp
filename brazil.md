# Brazil Mod

Brazil is a desolate dimension, filled with only green concrete wastelands and lava lakes. In it you can find naturally generated brazillages, which are the same as villages, but loot chests contain bottles of [cum](cum.md). Brazillagers naturally spawn in brazillages, and the hostile Brazilians hunt the landscape at night.

## Taxes

If you don't pay your taxes on time, you may get sent to brazil. Once in brazil, you will be forced to mine concrete to pay off your debt. Iron pickaxes can be acquired by right clicking the designated sign at spawn.

## Brazil Balances

Your brazil balance can be queried by clicking the designated sign at spawn. In order to pay your balance, right click the pay sign with green concrete in your inventory.

## Returning

If you have no outstanding balance, you may right click the sign at spawn to leave. All green concrete in your inventory automatically gets paid to the International Bank of Brazil upon returning.
