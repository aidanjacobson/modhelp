## The Canes Altar
To grow a canes, you need to first create the canes altar. This is built as follows:
- A block of quartz
- 4 quartz stairs facing outward on each side
- A quartz slab on top of the quartz block
- An item frame facing upward on top of the slab, with the canes seed inside.

After waiting 5 seconds, a canes will sprout from the seed. The canes will expand from the center of the altar 21 blocks in both the positive x and z direction, with the door facing North. Inside will be a canes worker that trades sugar cane for various combo meals.

Note that any blocks within the full canes area after sprouting will get destroyed and will not drop as items.
